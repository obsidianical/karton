# MicroBin

This is a fork of [MicroBin](https://github.com/szabodanika/microbin) intends to fix some bugs and add some features to MicroBin.

I deliberately removed docker support for now. 

Please do not ask for help in the issues of the original MicroBin repository, I'd be happy to help you with any problems here though. 

## TODOs:

- [ ] Rebrand
	- [ ] New name and logo
	- [ ] New README

	- [ ] Official central instance
	- [ ] Donation thing?

	- [x] Customizable wordset
